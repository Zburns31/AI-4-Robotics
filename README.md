# Artificial Intellgience for Robotics

**Instructor(s)**: Jay Summet / Sebastian Thrun \
**Course Page**: [Link](https://omscs.gatech.edu/cs-7638-artificial-intelligence-robotics)

This repository contains all the homework coding projects from the GT class Artificial Intelligence for Robotics. The main
instructor for this class is Sebastian Thrun, a pioneer of autonomous driving and the previous leader of Google
self-driving program. Sebastian gives a broad overview of the core subjects related to Robotics, including Localization,
Tracking, Motion planning, PID control and SLAM.

#### Course Content

---

This was my second course in the GT MS CS program and found it a solid introduction into the field of Robotics and AI. The
course is 16 weeks in length and covers a variety of different methods focused on Robot Localization and Mapping:

- Localization
  - Histogram Filters
  - Kalman Filters
  - Particle Filters
- Search / Path Planning
  - A\* Search
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
  - BFS Search
- PID Control (Proportional - Integral - Derivative)
- SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Planning)

#### Projects Overview

I really enjoyed the format of the course. Each set of lectures was accompanied by a problem and a project which tests your ability
to grasp the concepts and extend it in a more challenging implementation. The projects make up 55% of the course grade which I prefer
over exams. The projects for the course were:

- Asteroids - Kalman Filter
- Mars Glider - Particle Filter
- Rocket PID - PID Control
- Warehouse - Motion Planning and Search
- Indiana Drones - SLAM

The individual section summaries for topic covered in the class can be found under their respective folders in this repository. Overall,
the class was very enjoyable and very reasonable amount of work in order to digest the material and implement in a challenging
environment. I would highly recommend the class to anyone interested in robotics or as one of their first few classes in the GT
MS CS program
